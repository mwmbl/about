# about.mwmbl.org

The about website for Mwmbl. Currently work-in-progress.

## How to setup

This website is generated with 11ty. Therefore, you'll need to install [Bun](https://bun.sh) (a Node.js-compatible runtime).

1. Install dependencies (`bun i`)
2. Run it as a development server (`bunx eleventy --serve`) or build it without running (`bunx eleventy`)
